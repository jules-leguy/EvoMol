## Quickstart

Launching a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243">QED</a> optimization for 500 steps. Beware, you need 
to activate the evomolenv conda environment when you use EvoMol.

```python
from evomol import run_model
run_model({
    "obj_function": "qed",
    "optimization_parameters": {
        "max_steps": 500
    },

## Examples

### Designing complex objective functions

In order to aggregate several objective functions into a single function that will be optimized by EvoMol, it is
neccessary to use the dictionary (tree) function declaration for the ```"obj_function"``` attribute.

As an example, we design here an objective function to solve a virtual problem. The problem is to find a molecule
with a QED value of about 0.8, a CLScore value above 4, and about 70% of carbon atoms (ignoring the hydrogen atoms).

First, we design a function that counts the proportion of heteroatoms. 

```python
from rdkit.Chem import Lipinski, MolFromSmiles

def hetero_atoms_proportion(smiles):
    return Lipinski.NumHeteroatoms(MolFromSmiles(smiles)) / Lipinski.HeavyAtomCount(MolFromSmiles(smiles))
```

Then, the objective function can be designed this way. We consider that the most important property here is the QED 
value (coefficient 0.5) and that the two other properties are equally important (coefficient 0.25). The sum of the
coefficients may be different from 1, but since all the functions range between 0 and 1 here, this allows the final
function to also range between 0 and 1.

```python
objective_tree = {
    # The objective function is a linear combination of three sub-functions
    "type": "linear_combination",
    "coef": [0.5, 0.25, 0.25],
    "functions": [
        { 
            # Centering a Gaussian function on the 0.8 QED value
            "type": "gaussian",
            "function": "qed",
            "mu": 0.8,
            "sigma": 0.5, 
            "normalize": True
        },
        {   
            # The parameters of the sigmoid function are chosen so that the function value is above 0.99 when the CLScore value is above 4
            "type": "sigm_lin",
            "function": "clscore",
            "a": -1,
            "b": 3.5, 
            "lambda": 10
        },
        {
            # Centering a Gaussian function on the 0.7 proportion of hetero atoms
            "type": "gaussian",
            "function": {
                # Returning 1 - (proportion of heteroatoms) to represent the proportion of carbon atoms
                "type": "one_minus",
                "function": (hetero_atoms_proportion, "hetero_atoms_proportion")
            },
            "mu": 0.7,
            "sigma": 0.5, 
            "normalize": True
        },
    ]
}
```

The designed objective function can then be optimized by calling the run_model function of EvoMol

```python
from evomol import run_model

run_model({
    "obj_function": objective_tree,
    "io_parameters": {
        "model_path": "examples/multiobjective_run"
    }
})
```


### Drawing exploration trees

#### Large exploration tree

Performing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243">QED</a> optimization run of 500 steps, while 
recording the exploration data. 

```python
from evomol import run_model

model_path = "examples/2_large_tree"

run_model({
    "obj_function": "qed",
    "optimization_parameters": {
        "max_steps": 500},
    "io_parameters": {
        "model_path": model_path,
        "record_history": True
    }
})
```

Plotting the exploration tree with solutions colored according to their score. Nodes represent solutions. Edges 
represent mutations that lead to an improvement in the population.

```python
from evomol.plot_exploration import exploration_graph
exploration_graph(model_path=model_path, layout="neato")
```

![Large exploration tree](examples/figures/large_expl_tree.png)

#### Detailed exploration tree

Performing the experiment of mutating a fixed core of acetylsalicylic acid to increase its 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243">QED</a> value. 

```python
from evomol import run_model

model_path = "examples/3_detailed_tree"

run_model({
    "obj_function": "qed",
    "optimization_parameters": {
        "max_steps": 10,
        "pop_max_size": 10,
        "k_to_replace": 2,
        "mutable_init_pop": False
    },
    "io_parameters": {
        "model_path": model_path,
        "record_history": True,
        "smiles_list_init_path": "examples/acetylsalicylic_acid.smi"
    }
})
```

Plotting the exploration tree including molecular drawings, scores and action types performed during mutations.
Also plotting a table of molecular drawings.

```python
from evomol.plot_exploration import exploration_graph

exploration_graph(model_path=model_path, layout="dot", draw_actions=True, plot_images=True, draw_scores=True,
                  root_node="O=C(C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O", legend_scores_keys_strat=["total"], mol_size=0.3,
                  legend_offset=(-0.007, -0.05), figsize=(20, 20/1.5), legends_font_size=13)
```

## Environment variables and data requirements

### CLscore

As the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2020.00046/full"> CLscore </a> is dependent of prior 
data to be computed, EvoMol needs to be given the data location.
To do so, the ```$SHINGLE_LIBS``` environment variable must be set to the location of the shingle_libs folder that can
be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/reymond-group/GDBChEMBL"> here</a>.
 
### DFT and Molecular Mechanics optimization

To perform DFT and Molecular Mechanics computation (necessary for HOMO and LUMO optimization), you need to bind 
<a href="https://gaussian.com/glossary/g09/">Gaussian09</a> and 
<a href="https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0372-5">OpenBabel</a> with EvoMol.

To do so, the ```$OPT_LIBS``` variable must point to a folder containing : 
* run.sh : a script launching a DFT optimization with Gaussian09 of the input filepath given as parameter.
* obabel/openbabel-2.4.1 : directory containing an installation of OpenBabel 2.4.1. Make sure to also set OpenBabel's
```$BABEL_DATADIR``` environment variable to ```$OPT_LIBS/obabel/openbabel-2.4.1/data```.

You can install Open Babel by following these instructions

```shell script
$ mkdir obabel & cd obabel                                                               # Create and move to installation directory
$ wget https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/archive/refs/tags/openbabel-2-4-1.tar.gz   # Download sources
$ tar zxf openbabel-openbabel-2-4-1.tar.gz                                               # Extract sources
$ mv openbabel-openbabel-2-4-1 openbabel-2.4.1                                           # Rename directory
$ cd openbabel-2.4.1                                                                     # Go to installation directory
$ cmake .                                                                                # Preparing build (requires that cmake and g++ are installed)
$ make & make install                                                                    # Compilation and installation
```

### Checkmol descriptor

In order to use the checkmol descriptor for entropy evaluation, the ```$CHECKMOL_EXE``` environment variable must point 
to the executable of the 
<a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/norbert.haider/download/chemistry/checkmol/checkmol.pas">checkmol program</a>.

OpenBabel must also be installed (see above section).

### GuacaMol initial population

To use EvoMol for <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00839">GuacaMol</a> goal directed benchmarks 
optimization using the best scoring molecules from their subset of 
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D945/2605707">ChEMBL</a> as initial population, you need to :
* Download the <a href="https://figshare.com/projects/GuacaMol/56639">ChEMBL subset</a>.
* Give the path of the data using the ```"smiles_list_init_path"``` attribute.
* Insure that the ```"guacamol_init_top_100"``` attribute is set to True.

### rd_filters
To use the <a href=https://github.com/PatWalters/rd_filters>rd_filter program</a> as a filter of solutions that can be 
inserted in the population, the ```$FILTER_RULES_DATA``` environment variable must point to a folder containing the 
```rules.json``` and ```alert_collection.csv``` files.
